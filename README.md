This is for the TIC-TAC-TOE Project for the WDI
Below are the objectives and bonuses with tips:

Tic-Tac-Toe Project WDI GA first project.
This is a work branch for this project to make tic-tac-toe

See objectives:

* Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
* Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
* Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
* Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
* Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete (bonus: compete from separate devices)
* Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world
* Communicate with a back-end (which we'll provide for you) to store the state of your game.

Once (and only once) you've satisfied the core requirements, here are some additional goals that you can shoot for:

* If allowing players to compete from separate devices, display a "Waiting..." message while users are waiting to be matched.
* Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter.
* Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc).
* Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up.
* Add tableside chat to your game.
* Use localStorage to persist data locally, allowing games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity.

Tips

* Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* Use your Development Tools (console.log, debugger, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems.
* Work through the lessons in class, ask questions and schedule a 1on1 when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your Tic Tac Toe game each night, instead of, you know... procrastinating.
* Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* Read documentation (jQuery especially) at home to better understand hwo the tools you're using work.
* Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
