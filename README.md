TIC TAC TOE PROJECT FOR WDI -
Overview:

Creation of a Tic-Tao-Toe game for our WDI project.   A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe made to be a signal-page application using lessons we learned since we started WDI.

Users stories
•	Users most be able to use accounts by signing up, login, signing out, & change password
•	Uses should be able to play tic-tic-tac toe with another player
•	Users should be notified on who won the match
•	Users should be able to start a new game after a match end
•	User that log in first when playing will always be “X” aka player 1.

Technologies:
•	jQuery
•	JavaScript
•	AJEX/API
•	Github

Approach:
•	I started off with a general outline of what I wanted to game to look like via wireframe.
•	Next I started to structure my HTML file with a general layout base on my sketch and
created a main board for the game.
•	After the general layout I started to the game logic.  Getting X and O to show when click etc.
•	Once HTML/CSS/JS was put there together started the AJAX.
•	I started with the account info first – user creation, signup, sign-out, and new password.



Challenges
•	I thought I had a pretty good feel on what I wanted the site to look like and since I was
more comfortable with HTLM/CSS.  Then reality hit.  The site seems to busy; the layout was wrong and the feel was off.  I strip down most of the ideas I had since it was just too much for what it should be.

•	The logic was the next big hurdle.   The WDI program is a fast past environment for learning code.  I have always struggle to get a solid base understanding and felt behind.Even with a lot of effort put in after class it was not a easy hurdle.  I spent a lot of time “trashing” on a problem due to this.  But the time spent for me looking up on how to fix it and getting over it felt good.

•	Next come the issue with planning my code.  Though I had the wireframe code that I thought I would make, I ended not following it at all.  I was all over the place and felt like
each code I put in broke then I would spend hours reading up and attempting to fix it.

•	At this stage work/school life balance was off.  I usually stayed up till 11:30 to 12:00 am reviewing but when project time started I notice I was sleeping at 2 to 3am. This really affected me mental and felt drain.  I needed to break this habit (that being said while I type this as 3:00 AM)

•	Jquery – finding fixes with jquery seem ideal at first. It seems that I can fix an issue with a signal line s seems like a shortcut for most case to fit my needs. Now the Rabbit hole. I end up looking for JQuery commands to solve most of my problems. This actually did not make it easier but harder in most case since I had a hard time finding where I can introduce now code to fix or add to an area I went over with it.

•	The API was another big challenge.  Not really paying attention on the game API when I started was not a good idea, I was already near the end and I had to tailor most of my things to attempt to make sure it communicated properly. Since my mind set was get a working game and get everything else working after.

Final Thoughts:

I’m glad this project is over. It was not easily to try to meet the minimum requirements.  Though I have a better understanding of the jQuery and JavaScript after this project , I’m pretty disappointed in my foundation. If I had another week, I most likely would just redo all my code and kept it simple to what I know instead of introducing other elements that I was not familiar with. I’m glad this was done and I felt happy of the final product, yet disappointed with the process on how I handled the creation of the product.
